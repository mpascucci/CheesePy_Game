# CheesePy

**CheesePy** is a maze-based game crafted to facilitate the understanding of fundamental **principles in computer programming**.

Players navigate a mouse through various challenges, each level **increasing in difficulty** from basic to more advanced.
They provide Python code to direct the mouse's actions.

Through conquering these levels, you will grasp essential programming concepts
like conditions (if-else), loops (while/for), functions, and language syntax.
